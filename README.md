clone the repo

expo: 
1. https://expo.io/learn
2. I'm not sure if it will force you to login to my account but I don't think it should


AWS: 
in the terminal
1. npm install -g awsmobile-cli
2. awsmobile configure
3. from here you should be met with some options to input the keys and timezone (choose: US-West-2)
